            <p>Thank you very much.</p>
            <p>I'll be talking to you today about Domain-Driven JavaScript Development using Backbone.</p>
            <p>But, before we get into what that means, let’s take a quick look at this picture, because I think it provides a useful metaphor for software development.</p>
            <p>If you look off in the distance of the center of the photograph, you’ll see a just-launched ship sailing away.</p>
            <p>And here at the top, you’ll notice a crane bringing in the first beam that will form the keel of a new ship to be constructed in the same drydock that just launched the previous ship.</p>
            <p>In the same way, projects never stop coming for us. We launch a project, and while it’s still in sight, we start the next.</p>
            <p>We need an architectural framework to manage the constant turnover of projects so that we don’t build sinking ships.</p>

            <p>So I'm Bob Holt. I work on the Open Web at Bocoup here in Boston.</p>
            <p>Before joining Bocoup, I worked at a large consulting firm that specialized in clients in the financial and energy markets.</p>
            <p>These firms need big applications - things like trading platforms for mutual fund portfolio managers or applications that help an energy company manage the flow of resources throughout their system.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, those applications were built on top of Java or .NET, and Domain-Driven Design was our preferred strategy.</p>
            <p>So when these applications started to move to the web platform, we wanted to see if we could make DDD work there, too, because these applications are no less complex, and need the same level of data integrity and stability.</p>

            <p>Now, before we go further, let's be clear that this isn't the only way to architect applications. This is one strategy, and is really suited to a particular type of large data-centric application.</p>
            <p>Other approaches are <em>equally valid</em>. We'll see a very different approach tomorrow when John Hann shows us CujoJS. Just pick what works for your particular needs.</p>

            <p>So what is Domain-Driven Design? Let’s start by defining “Domain.”</p>

            <p>The domain is the subject of the program. We can also call it the “business” of the software.</p>

            <p>So Domain-Driven design says that for complex projects, primary focus should be on the domain and its real-world logic.</p>

            <p>DDD offers a collection of principles, techniques, and best practices to help us manage software applications based on this domain.</p>

            <p>So what if you’re software isn’t complex? </p>

            <p>Like I said, we're not dogmatic about DDD. In that case, you probably don’t have the luxury of time, budget, or even team expertise to implement a robust domain-driven application.</p>

            <p>On the front-end, we’ve built sample implementations in iOS, Silverlight, ExtJS, and now Backbone. </p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The first thing we want to do is figure out our framework. We want a framework that will support our Domain-Driven ambition as much as possible. This includes staying out of our way when we need it to.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="backbone">
          <blockquote>In an ecosystem where overarching, decides-everything-for-you frameworks are commonplace, and many libraries require your site to be restructured to suit their look, feel, and default behavior — Backbone should continue to be a tool that gives you the freedom to design the full experience of your web application. <p class="cite">Jeremy Ashkenas</p></blockquote>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So, it probably comes as no surprise to anyone in this room that we chose Backbone, and I think Jeremy summed it up perfectly in his blog post announcing Backbone 1.0.</p>

            <p>In our line of building complex, customized, data-driven applications, the importance of this cannot be overstated.</p>

            <p>Every time I’ve built even a moderately-complex application with any framework that tries to do more for you, I find at least one situation where I need to override some default behavior, and it takes at least ten times longer than it should to do so. I've never run into this flaw with Backbone, and I love it for that.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The first and most important step in this process is the discovery phase.</p>

            <p>In this phase, we consult with the business experts to start to piece together the domain model, which again, is just the idea in the experts’ heads.</p>

            <p>In this, we start to compile what is known as a ubiquitous language</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="ubiquitous">
          <h2>Ubiquitous Language</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The concept of a ubiquitous language is shared with Behavior-Driven Development.</p>

            <p>It's a well-defined terminology that is shared between all members of the team and is used in all code, documentation, and written and verbal communication.</p>

            <p>We want every person who touches this project, from the client to the business analyst to the project manager to all of the developers to speak the same language.</p>

            <p>Instead of trying to explain things in our lingo having to do with design patterns and databases and such, we instead rigorously define terms as the client understands them.</p> 

            <p>Then we don’t have to translate anything between the client and the developers, we’re all speaking the same language.</p>

        <section id="highlighted" data-state="highlighted" style="height: 100%;">
          
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So here’s an example in this application of finding this ubiquitous language. Of course we wouldn’t have an application to look at necessarily, but this just illustrates the concept.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So the developer has a good basic understanding of the domain, but we continue to iterate on both the domain model and the ubiquitous language.</p>

            <p>Here, the developer is recapping their understanding of the domain model. </p>

            <p>But it turns out that the domain expert actually thinks of this a bit differently.</p>

        <section id="iterate-3" data-state="iterate-3" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So instead of horseshoeing this new information into our existing implementation, we’re going to take time to incorporate this new concept properly into both our mental model AND our software model.</p>

          <h2>Iterative process</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The domain model (and therefore the software implementation of that model) will continue to change throughout the project. </p>

            <p>Better abstractions, epiphanies, and clarifications will cause us to continuously perfect our understanding and implementation of the model.</p>

          <h2>Agile?</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This raises the question: does this require an agile methodology?</p>

            <p>Not necessarily, if you are still willing to iteratively perfect the domain model, but you can maybe see how an agile methodology would not only accommodate, but encourage this iterative process.</p>

            <p>But how do we iteratively change this model, which is central to the rest of our application, without breaking everything else? That brings us to the next step in our process.</p>

        <section id="isolate" data-state="isolate" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We need to isolate the domain.</p>

            <p>We can conceptualize our application as different loosely-coupled layers. At the bottom, we have our infrastructure, which is all of our supporting framework, repositories, et cetera.</p>

            <p>Above that, we have the software implementation of our domain model. This is separated away from the rest of our application in order to preserve data integrity.</p>

            <p>Next, we have our application layer, which makes our specific appllication hum along.</p>

            <p>And above that, we have our UI layer, which in our situation will be made up entirely of Backbone Views.</p>

            <p>To preserve loose-coupling in this architecture, we keep these levels strictly separated.</p>

            <p>The levels above are allowed – but not necessarily encouraged – to have direct reference to the levels below, but going up the stack, we only want to communicate via events.</p>

            <p>And if you think about this, it doesn’t make sense for the domain model to know what kind of application is being built on top of it, or for the application to know the exact state of every view. These layers only need to fire events when they change and allow the layers above to respond however they like.</p>

            <p>We can see this separation in the file system for our application.</p>

            <p>Domain is obviously our domain layer.</p>

            <p>What we've called framework is our application layer - it contains various utilities and base object constructors that we use throughout our app.</p>

            <p>Pages and Widgets make up our UI layer.</p>

            <p>We'll talk a little bit more about services in a bit, but this is basically our infrastructure layer.</p>

            <p>Now, like any software application, this doesn't stay 100% pristine. We may sacrifice purity for maintainability as we start building our software, but we do that explicitly, and after using this as our base for starting to express the model in our software.</p>

        <section id="express">
          <h2>Express the Model in Software</h2>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When we begin expressing the model as a software implementation, our biggest battle is going to be against complexity.</p>

            <p>We can try to be 100% accurate in our representation of the model, but we will be buried in the implementation details: details that eventually have performance implications as the system tries to keep track of this complexity.</p>

            <p>So how do we simplify our representation of the domain model?</p>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="relationship">
          <h2>Clarify Relationship Between Objects</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            <p>The first step in expressing the domain model in our software is to clarify the relationship between objects.</p>

            <p>In the real world, most objects that we would model have a intertwined network of bidirectional associations.</p>

            <p>As we come to fully understand the domain model, many of these relationships can be simplified or eliminated altogether in order to make our implementation easier to produce.</p>

            <p>Next, we distinguish between entities, value objects, and services.</p>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="entities">
          <h2>Entities</h2>

          <aside class="notes">

            <p>Entities are objects that have identity – if we need to keep track of a particular instance of an object throughout its entire lifecycle, it is an entity, and we need to treat it in a special way.</p>

            <p>People, financial accounts, anything that we want to assign and ID to is most likely an entity.</p>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="value">
          <h2>Value Objects</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            <p>Value objects are objects that do not have identity. They are commodity objects that are mainly used as attributes on an entity object or passed between entity objects as message parameters.</p>

            <p>For example, on most airlines, a seat is an entity – a particular seat is in a particular spot in an aircraft and seats a particular person. But on Southwest, there is no assigned seating, so the seat is just an object with the attribute of being able to hold a person. There is no need to distinguish between separate seats.</p>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="services">
          <h2>Services</h2>
          <aside class="notes">

            <p>And finally, services are the parts of the domain model that aren’t really objects – they are more actions.</p>
            <p>For example, in Bullsfirst, we have an Instrument Service that goes out and gets the current prices of all of the stocks (or instruments in our ubiquitous language) in our system.</p>

            <p>Alright, so once we’ve distinguished the our entities, objects, and services, all we have left to do in this basic introduction is to set aggregate boundaries and implement resources and factories.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="aggregate1" data-state="aggregate1" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>If we're not thinking about it, we might set up our domain model with a bunch of objects that have various relationships to each other.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="aggregate2" data-state="aggregate2" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Then part of our application might change an object's state at one point, while another part of our application alters another object.</p>

            <p>Or maybe, even worse, different parts of our application try to change the same object at the same time.</p>

            <p>When external parts of our UI or application layer can modify all parts of our domain model willy-nilly, it becomes impossible to maintain data integrity.</p>

          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="aggregate3" data-state="aggregate3" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The solution is to define aggregates based on closely-related objects in our domain model.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="aggregate4" data-state="aggregate4" style="height: 100%;">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>External objects can then only reference a defined aggregate root, which must be an entity object. This root controls access to, and enforces business rules within the aggregate, which can contain both entities or value objects.</p>

            <p>Now that we've protected our objects, we need to manage their lifecycle.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="repositories">
          <h2>Repostories</h2>

          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Global interface</li>
            <li>Provides illusion of in-memory collection of all objects</li>
            <li>Deals with the data store</li>
            <li>Caches as necessary</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In Backbone, dealing with the data store involves invoking the Model or Collection’s own fetch() method.</p>

            <p>In something like Bullsfirst, our data could quickly become stale, so we aren’t currently caching most (if any) of our data requests.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section id="factories">
          <h2>Factories</h2>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Take on the responsibility of creating new objects</li>
            <li>Tying to domain or application can be ungainly</li>
            <li>However, Backbone has Collection.add and Model.validate methods that can take care of this for us</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The Repository returns data, but the factory creates new objects out of whole cloth.</p>

            <p>Tying the responsibility of creating and validating objects to either the domain or the application can be really kludgy, so we generally want to avoid that.</p>

            <p>However, Backbone takes care of a lot of that for us between Collection.add() and Model.validate(), so in the spirit of not fighting against our framework, we’ll take that help. </p>

            <p>Thanks, Backbone!</p>

            <p>So this all just scratches the surface of building a domain-driven application on the front-end, and I haven’t shown much code.</p>

            <p>Domain-Driven Design, and I’d argue architecting any complex piece of software, comes down more to how we think about and approach the problem than how we code it.</p>

            <p>When you come across what seems to be a fairly complex software problem, DON’T START CODING.</p> 

            <p>Take a cue from this kid and think about it for a while. </p>
