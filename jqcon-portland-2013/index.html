      <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      <p>I'll be talking to you today about Home-Growing Top-Notch Developers.</p>
      <p>That sounds awesome, right?</p>
      <p>Well, it is! And not just because I'm trying to keep you awake at 5:15 on a Friday.</p>

      <p>A show of hands: how many people in here are trying to hire JavaScript developers right now?</p>
      <p>And how many of you are finding it pretty easy to find them?</p>
      <p>Right. So the problem we're facing right now is that we all want expert developers to fill out our teams.</p>
      <p>But either there aren't enough of them to go around.</p>
      <p>So we're forced to hire developers at a lower skill level than we would like, and ramp them up so that we don't have to turn down work.</p>
      <p>This isn't necessarily a situation we want ot be in, but if we can hold on to these developers, they can become valuable assets to the organization.</p>
      <p>So how do we do this?</p>

    <h2>Expertise</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Let's assume that if we're trying to build expert developers, then what we're trying to do is cultivate this abstract notion of "expertise."</p>
      <p>So we want to define what expertise is and then figure out how we can build it in individuals and teams.</p>

      <p>A lot of times when we think about experts and expertise, we draw this mental distinction between novices and experts and say that you're either one or the other.</p>
      <p>But, things are a little more complex than that</p>

    <h2>Skill Acquisition</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Over the years, quite a few scholars have tried to define the way we gain expertise as a process of "skill acquisition."</p>
      <p>They all try to define the gray area between novice and expert.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="dreyfus">
    <img src="/images/mind-over-machine.jpg" alt="Mind Over Machine: Cover Image" />

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Probably the most widely-recognized of these is the Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition.</p>
      <p>This model was defined by Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus in their book <cite>Mind over Machine</cite>.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="dreyfus-list">
    <h2>Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition</h2>

    <ol class="bullet-list" style="width: 35.725%;">
      <li>Novice</li>
      <li>Advanced Beginner</li>
      <li>Competence</li>
      <li>Proficient</li>
      <li>Expert</li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The Dreyfus model describes five skill levels between novice and expert.</p>
      <p>At the novice stage, everything we do must be dictated to us, and we aren't capable of understanding the big picture.</p>
      <p>As we progress through the various stages, we become more self-directed, and start to see how our part fits into the whole.</p>
      <p>As we continue toward proficiency and on to expert, decision-making becomes easier - even automatic - and we begin to anticipate outcomes.</p>
      <p>The only time we need to stop and think about our actions is when we face a truly new situation or run into a roadblock.</p>
      <p>Dreyfus says, "An expert's skill has become so much a part of him that he need be no more aware of it than he is of his own body."</p>
      <p>We can see the matrix. We have a vision of what's possible within our domain.</p>

      The problem is not how to turn novices into experts faster or with less work. The problem is how to ensure that novices develop into experts rather than into experienced nonexperts. <a href="#/references-1">[1]</a>
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>There's no guarantee we're going to make it all the way to the expert level.</p>
      <p>That's why there are so few true experts out there.</p>
      <p>Think of all the people you know - in any line of work - that have been practicing for years, but seem to be stuck at some median skill level.</p>
      <p>It's really common.</p>
      <p>We're not trying to speed up this process where novices are going to just go ahead become experts anyway.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to lead our teams toward expertise, instead of the much more likely scenario of having done something for a very long time, but still not being very good at it.</p>
      <p>The Skill Acquisition Model shows us what this looks like, but it doesn't necessarily tell us how to get there.</p>
      <p>And we still haven't answered exactly what expertise is.</p>

      <p>If you're like most people, you might have come in here thinking that expertise was measured in knowledge about a topic.</p>
      <p>That's not really right, but you can't really be blamed for that.</p>
      <p>This idea that an expert is just a repository of knowledge has its roots in the positivist philosophy of science.</p>

    <h2>Positivism</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Positivist philosophy came out of the Enlightenment, and suggests that any action or behavior, including human thought and action, can be ultimately boiled down and explained by rules, logic, math, and physics.</p>

      <p>But it turns out that intelligence is really hard, because you can't just feed a bunch of rules and algorithms into a computer to have it make good decisions.</p>
      <p>That makes sense to us now, but the problem is that we've been trying to do the same thing in teaching <strong>PEOPLE</strong> for the last hundred years.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>What researchers have come to realize just in the last few decades is that being an expert isn't just knowing a lot about something.</p>
      <p>When we pump somebody's head full of facts and rules, we're feeding them what they call <em>declarative</em> knowledge, which - don't get me wrong - is a useful basis for expertise.</p>
      <p>This is the knowledge we turn to whenever we actually have to think about what we're doing.</p>
      <p>The problem is that this is generally theoretical knowledge.</p>
      <p>It's the what and when, but not the how or why.</p>
      <p>What we really need is the know-how to apply this knowledge practically.</p>
      <p>Let's look at an example.</p>
    </aside>

  <section id="prototypal-inheritance">
    <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Everybody's favorite JavaScript concept!</p>
      <p>A show of hands: how many people here read an article, blog post, or book chapter on prototypal inheritance when you were first learning JS?</p>
      <p>How many people got to the end and said, "I completely understand this" without ever laying a finger on the keyboard?</p>
      <p>If you did, then you're way smarter than everyone else and you should go cure cancer or something.</p>
      <p>Most normal humans cannot grasp everything about prototypal inheritance</p>
      <p>or CSS layouts</p>
      <p>or Git</p>
      <p>or MVC architecture</p>
      <p>or pretty much anything else we do on a daily basis just by reading about them.</p>
      <p>Sure, they could memorize facts and give you a nice tidy definition, or probably do well on a multiple-choice test.</p>
      <p>But they couldn't actually build something with those concepts.</p>
      <p>But if expertise isn't straight-up knowledge, then what is it?</p>
    </aside>

  <section id="retrieval">
    <h2>Procedural Memory</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>There's this thing called "procedural memory."</p>
      <p>The idea has been around since the early 1800s, but it wasn't until the last half of the 20th century that it was generally recognized as an integral part of skill acquisition and expertise.</p>
      <p>When we humans do anything, some memory of that is stored in our subconscious.</p>
      <p>When we go to repeat an action we have stored in this subconscious procedural memory, we don't have to think about it.</p>
      <p>It's Like tying your shoes or signing your name.</p>
      <p>Over time, the abilities we can unconsciously reproduce grow in both number and complexity.</p>
      <p>Over even more time, we can apply this procedural memory to new, seemingly unrelated problems.</p>
      <p>At this point people start calling it "intuition" or "magic," and we say, "Yeah. That's right."</p>
      <p>But how does procedural memory help the problem-solver?</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="threads" style="height:100%;">

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>It turns out that the average human can only keep somewhere around four things actively in mind at the same time.</p>
      <p>Anything we can store in our procedural memory can be applied automatically.</p>
      <p>We don't even have to think about it.</p>
      <p>This frees up our precious brain-threads and allows us to tackle more complex problems.</p>
      <p>We're able to look at a problem and immediately pattern-match away the stuff we already know - eliminating the noise like with those secret decoder glasses.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="patterns">
    <img src="images/decoder.jpg" alt="Decoder Glasses"/>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>What we're left with is the difficult part (for us) of the problem to solve.</p>
      <p>We can then leverage our book-learning against this remainder.</p>
      <p>I call this "reinvesting your cognitive dividends."</p>
      <p>The cool thing is that this characterizes ALL learning.</p>
      <p>It turns out that the people we call "experts" just seem to have a larger repository of this kind of information.</p>
      <p>This means they are able to eliminate larger parts of the problem at a glance.</p>
      <p>This frees them up to concentrate on parts of the problem a less-expert practitioner wouldn't even be able to approach yet.</p>
      <p>This is why the Novice and the Advanced Beginner <em>have to</em> work on simpler problems under a lot of direction.</p>
      <p>Their "repertoire" hasn't grown to the point where they can take on more complex problems.</p>

    <h2>Reflection-in-Action</h2>

    <div>

    </div>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Donald Schön, a professor and specialist in organizational learning at MIT for nearly 30 years called this process of pattern-matching "Knowing-in-Action".</p>
      <p>He went on to suggest that the expert followed this up with a process of "Reflection-in-Action" where they critically reflect on their intuitions, testing their validity in the current context.</p>
      <p>This is important for both the initial development of as well as continuous improvement in a skill.</p>
      <p>This process of pattern-matching and reflecting on the results is how someone makes their way up Dreyfus's skill acquisition ladder.</p>
      <p>So why doesn't everybody make their way to the top of their profession?</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at a few things that observational research has shown experts and non-experts do differently.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="what-do-experts-do">
    <blockquote>
      ...in order to be experts, people must choose to address the problems of their field at the upper limit of the complexity they can handle... For it is through such working at the upper edge that people develop the deep knowledge that makes expert performance possible <a href="#/references-1">[1]</a>.
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Experts, we find, like new challenges</p>
      <p>They actively seek out learning opportunities.</p>
      <p>They tend to take on problems that increase their expertise.</p>
      <p>They regard everything as an opportunity to learn something.</p>
      <p>New information that contradicts their mental model leads them to challenge their previous conceptions.</p>
    </aside>

  </section>

  <section id="what-do-nonexperts-do" data-state="bored" style="height:100%;">
    <small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jope1978/3969662362/">Aburrido / Bored</a> by Leandro Suarez <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License</a></small>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>On the other hand, experienced non-experts -- those who are stuck in their progression -- are more concerned about doing the "right" thing.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps more accurately, they are concerned about not doing the wrong thing.</p>
      <p>They fear screwing up and what it means for their job or reputation, so they are less likely to take chances in an effort to expand their expertise.</p>
      <p>They are more likely to only take on problems where they don't have to try very hard.</p>
      <p>When presented with new conflicting information, the nonexpert tends to make a best-fit match against their previous experience and disregard information that disrupts their worldview.</p>
      <p>But why do people develop in these two different ways?</p>
      <p>Why is one person an expertise-seeker, and another complacent?</p>
      <p>Yes, people have different innate levels of intelligence and capacity to learn.</p>
      <p>However, in most disciplines -- and I'd argue that software development is, in fact, one of those -- the intellect required to do well is well within reach of most adult humans.</p>
      <p>Research into IQ has shown that beyond a base level required to do a job, higher IQ doesn't translate into better performance.</p>
      <p>So if most people are smart enough to program - or at least those pursuing it as a career have the minimum ability required, then the differentiator we're left with is the motivation to excel.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>In the book Surpassing Ourselves, Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia found three factors that motivate individuals build their expertise:</p>
      <p>As an aside, if you're going to read one book on the subject of expertise, I recommend this one.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="causes-of-motivation">
    <h2>Causes of Motivation</h2>

    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Flow</li>
      <li>Expert Subcultures</li>
      <li>Heroic Element</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The three factors they identify are flow, expert subcultures, and an heroic element.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="flow">
    <h2>Flow</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The first thing they found motivates people is flow. You might think of it as being "in The Zone".</p>
      <p>It's this state of total absorption, total control, and loss of self-consciousness, where everything is in harmony, negative thinking and self-doubts are absent, and performance reaches its peak.</p>
      <p>Some psychologists think that this is what we feel when we're getting the most enjoyment out of what we're doing.</p>
      <p>When we chase after the flow state, we're trying to maximize our enjoyment of an activity.</p>
      <p>Now, different people chase after this state to different degrees, but the euphoria this state brings can be like a drug.</p>
      <p>Flow state requires working at the edge of one's competence -- right on that precipice between success and failure.</p>
      <p>The problem is that as we become accustomed to certain activities, we have to increase the complexity by developing new skills or taking on new problems.</p>
      <p>We have to get better. We MUST get better.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="expert-subcultures">
    <h2>Expert Subcultures</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Bereiter and Scardamalia also talk about this idea of expert subcultures as another motivating factor for advancement.</p>
      <p>In many fields, there is this subculture that embodies the ideals and goals of expert development.</p>
      <p>It can be formal like a professional association or informal like a Meetup group or, hopefully, the team you work with in your office every day.</p>
      <p>This expert subculture often offers help and cooperation toward success, as well as providing recognition of accomplishments from one's peers.</p>
      <p>Involvement in an expert subculture often involves participation in pursuing group ideals or projects, which can be challenging, and a source of growth.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, as group members improve their individual competence, it ups the ante for other group members.</p>
      <p>As long as the group is a cooperative one, this has the effect of bringing everyone up faster.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="heroic-element">
    <h2>The Heroic Element</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>And then there are those who people -- and perhaps more in this industry than in some others -- who are motivated solely by a sense of innate heroism.</p>
      <p>These people have no expert community to help them grow, and may or may not be chasing some sort of flow state.</p>
      <p>But, they have the discipline to sit down and force themselves to climb the ladder of expertise alone.</p>

      <p>Now I'd venture to suggest that every software developer has exhibited symptoms of this during at least <em>some</em> point in their career.</p>
      <p>Most development jobs require a minimum level of knowledge, and most JavaScript developers have to teach it to themselves.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This idea that motivation is the big decider between experts and nonexperts is why I advocate hiring for passion above almost all else.</p>
      <p>If someone is truly passionate about a subject, they will have the drive to achieve the upper limits of expertise in that subject.</p>
      <p>If not, they are likely destined to become "merely competent."</p>
      <p>Of course, there are other factors in hiring, but I have found over the years that passion is a remarkably good predictor of success.</p>

    <h2>Building Expertise</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Now that we have defined expertise, we can talk about how to go about getting it - or more to the point of this talk: help others around us get it, too.</p>
      <p>But first a word of warning: </p>
    </aside>

  <section id="danger">
    <blockquote>
      Expertise in a particular domain does not guarantee that one is good at helping others learn it. In fact, expertise can sometimes hurt teaching because many experts forget what is easy and what is difficult for students <a href="#/references-1">[5]</a>.
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We've been talking about expertise and how much time and effort it takes to gain it in a particular set of skills.</p>
      <p>But let me clearly state what I hope is obvious.</p>
      <p>Development expertise is not teaching expertise.</p>
      <p>You can be a great developer and an awful teacher. Or vice versa.</p>
      <p>But here are some things I found that will help us be better teachers..</p>
      <p>Here are some things from what I've read and experienced to help us build our teaching expertise:</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="previous-experience">
    <h2>Teach From Previous Experience</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>People learn in different ways and bring different ways of looking at the world into their practice.</p>
      <p>One of the best things we can do for a student is to leverage these past experiences in the new domain.</p>
      <p>What I mean is take something they understand very well that they have somehow picked up in their past, and use it as a basis for new learning.</p>
      <p>This accomplishes two things:</p>
      <p>First, when we build metaphors from experience and knowledge the student already has, it makes the new knowledge more concrete.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we're interested in ultimately transferring this knowledge into practice in order to build expertise.</p>
      <p>Knowledge transfer is a learnable skill in itself.</p>
      <p>When we create metaphors that transfer the student's existing knowledge into the new domain, we provide an implicit example of this same type of knowledge transfer.</p>
      <p>Find an applicable metaphor from their experience to help them understand development concepts.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="visible-thinking">
    <h2>Make Thinking Visible</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Another useful thing we can provide for learners is to make their thinking visible.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, even when we make all of these metaphors and go the extra mile to explain something, the student still doesn't really get it.</p>
      <p>So, if we can make their thinking visible - ask them to reason our their solutions out loud, it makes any faulty conceptions or assumptions incredibly apparent.</p>
      <p>We can accomplish this through pair programming, whiteboarding, or just straight conversation.</p>
      <p>We can then use the findings from this as a new starting point for helping the student re-conceptualize the concept, possibly by adjusting or abandoning our metaphor.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="logical-creative">
    <h2>Engage Both Sides of the Brain</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We typically focus on learning as a process that targets the logical portion of our brain.</p>
      <p>But there's this whole creative side to our brain.</p>
      <p>Now hopefully you were all in Jenn Schiffer's talk on creative coding earlier today.</p>
      <p>If you weren't, I suggest watching the video as soon as you can.</p>
      <p>We need to find ways to engage the creative side of our brain in the learning process as much as the logical side.</p>
      <p>I think we're uniquely equipped in software development to do both simultaneously because of things like creative coding.</p>
      <p>When we teach programming concepts, we should be flexible enough to use creative coding to help our learners solidify their understanding.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="learning-strategies">
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So, everybody learns in different ways, but if we can draw from their previous experience, engage both the logical and creative sides of the brain, and be flexible, we can help the knowledge stick.</p>

    <h2>Building Expertise</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Now that we have a definition of expertise and some learning strategies, let's talk about actually building expertise.</p>
      <p>We'll start with individuals, and move on to teams.</p>
    </aside>

  <section id="building-experience">
    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So we have seen that experts are experts because they have a wealth of experience from which to draw.</p>
      <p>This experience allows them to reduce the problem they're facing to a greater degree than non-expert, which frees up more resources to attack the remainder of the problem.</p>
      <p>So all we need to do is gain experience, right? Just solve the same problems over and over?</p>
      <p>Of course not.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>But a casual reading of a book like Outliers and its discussion of how it takes 10,000 hours to master something might lead you to believe that.</p>
      <p>But this is the path to madness.</p>
      <p>The problems we solve need to be more and more complex over time, otherwise we're not learning anything.</p>

      <p>You can't put in 10,000 hours of doing the same thing over and over.</p>
      <p>The Beatles were an example of this 10,000 hour theory, and when asked about it, Paul McCartney said this: </p>
    </aside>

  <section id="mccartney">
    <blockquote>
      I think there is a lot of truth in it... I mean there were an awful lot of bands that were out in Hamburg who put in 10,000 hours and didn't make it, so it's not a cast-iron theory. I think, however, when you look at a group who has been successful... I think you always will find that amount of work in the background. But I don't think it's a rule that if you do that amount of work, you're going to be as successful as the Beatles. <a href="#/references-1">[2]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>A careful reading of Outliers points out that 10,000 hours is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for expertise.</p>
      <p>It is only by continuing to work on harder problems - working at the edge of our competence where we actually have to try hard - that we can continue to increase our expertise.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>When we hit the edge of our competence, we don't go in knowing the solution to our problem.</p>

      <p>So, we can think about problem-solving not as supplying answers we already know, but as experimenting with different solutions in this probing, exploratory way.</p>

      <p>We can consider the problem solved.</p>

    <h2>Teams as Expert Subcultures</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Building expertise in teams can be seen as building an expert subculture within our organization.</p>
      <p>Remember: expert subcultures are a possible motivating factor for building expertise, so the idea is that if we can build one, it can be somewhat self-sustaining.</p>
      <p>If you're a developer and you're not working in an expert team, then you can either build one or join one.</p>
      <p>Since your everyday work community is the one you're in most often, I would hope that it is filling that place for you.</p>
      <p>But if not, seek out Meetups, Hack-a-thons, or any other gathering of like-minded developers.</p>
      <p>It is an integral part of your personal growth.</p>
      <p>But if you're looking to build a great team, how do you do it?</p>

    <h2>Trainings and Conferences</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and conferences are great ways to introduce developers to skills you don't already have in-house.</p>
      <p>But they don't really lose their value, even after you start building an expert team.</p>
      <p>Yes, you learn new things at trainings and conferences, but I don't even think those are the most important aspects.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the two most important things you get out of trainings and conferences are inspiration and professional socialization.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="inspiration">
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and Conferences should be inspirational.</p>
      <p>There is no way someone is going to be able to retain all of the information presented in a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, a well-run training or conference should provide plenty of examples of advanced concepts.</p>
      <p>This should inspire the learner and cause them to aspire to greater expertise.</p>
      <p>In addition, great teachers and speakers can become role models of some sort for new developers.</p>
      <p>I know that speakers from the first conference I went to have been and continue to be unconscious role models for me.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Professional socialization helps to establish and reinforce appropriate social behaviors within the community.</p>
      <p>This is such an important part of being a professional that it was institutionalized hundreds of years ago in the British legal profession in what are called "Inns of Court."</p>
      <p>The Inns of Court combine the functions of a Bar Association and Social Club, and some go back to at least the 14th century.</p>
      <p>Anyone hoping to join the legal profession to this day has to go through a system of Inns of Court dinners that reinforce the social norms in the community.</p>
      <p>These Inns of Court dinners also provide opportunities for networking, benchmarking of your skills against the industry, as well as learning and even emotional support.</p>

    <h2>Create an Atmosphere of Cooperation</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Some of the research we've seen in the last twenty years seems to show that while competition can be helpful for some types of learners, in general a cooperative atmosphere is superior for group learning.</p>
      <p>In a cooperative atmosphere, individuals are encouraged to contribute their particular strengths to the community.</p>
      <p>This allows several people to work within on their expertise at once, constantly changing roles between learner and teacher.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Another book I highly recommend -- How People Learn -- describes classroom situations where an unwritten rule pervades the environment: Never get caught making a mistake or not knowing an answer.</p>
      <p>This norm can keeps students from asking questions when they do not understand the material or to explore new questions and hypotheses.</p>
      <p>This is also true of development teams.</p>
      <p>Interviews of a large number of professionals in the UK stressed the point that working in a situation where it had been easy to ask questions, without feeling embarrassed, had been of considerable benefit.</p>
      <p>We WANT people to ask questions when they don't understand. We WANT people to explore groundbreaking new questions and attempt to prove new hypotheses.</p>

      <p>But we need to find ways to give people the ability to fail.</p>
      <p>This is why some places offer internships or shadowing opportunities or personal project time.</p>

      <p>In professional development circles today, we'd call this coaching.</p>

      <p>In our realm, this can be pair programming, whiteboarding sessions, code reviews, or preferably all of that and more.</p>
      <p>Some places do these things, and that's great.</p>

      <p>As you see someone come to grasp a particularly difficult concept, your mirror neurons - these neurons that fire both when you do an action and when you SEE someone do an action - fire, and you're transported back to when you first had your ah-ha moment.</p>

      <p>We as developers can probably shoulder a bit of blame for cheapening the word "design" to mean something along the lines of "making websites pretty."</p>
      <p>But design requires is really about the big picture, and planning how everything comes together to form a complete whole.</p>
      <p>As much as we like to talk about the tech stuff in software development: libraries and algorithms and stuff, actually building applications requires a design mentality.</p>
      <p>That's why we use terms like software <em>architecture</em> and API <em>design</em>.</p>

      <p>This is exactly what Schön advocates - for any professional endeavor.</p>
      <p>Designers and architects have known for years that learning design requires gradually building competence alongside senior practitioners in a relatively low-risk environment.</p>
      <p>That's why design schools are set up as studios with a large practicum component and instructors coaching students to help them discover the process of design.</p>
      <p>In many practicums, groups of students are as important to one another as the instructor, and sometimes even take on the coach's role.</p>
      <p>But we've seen that this same type environment is good for building expertise in any subject.</p>

      <p>Even if we're still learning, we can be a coach, just like in the design studio.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more so, because in the work environment, the line between teacher and student doesn't exist.</p>

      <p>We devoted yet another session to describing and talking about prototypal inheritance.</p>
      <p>But THIS time, we had an exercise prepared for everyone: build a constructor for a pop-up modal.</p>
      <p>Then, build constructors that extend this base modal object to create a video modal, an image modal, or a form modal (or something like that).</p>
      <p>The team could use this as a downtime project - whenever they rolled off of a project or got bored at home, they could work on it.</p>
      <p>They were free to take as long as they needed, use whatever resources they wanted, and share suggestions and discussion amongst themselves.</p>
      <p>They could also ask the other "instructor" and me for help.</p>
      <p>As each person completed the project, we would sit down as a team and code-review it.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So to summarize, becoming an expert at something is a long process requiring progressive problem-solving at the edge of one's competence.</p>
      <p>We can aid this within teams by creating a cooperative atmosphere in which failure is an option and the learner is guided to discover how the practice of software design as a whole works.</p>
      <p>If we follow the model of the design studio and work as coaches alongside our learners, it will be beneficial for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>And if you're trying to improve your craft, but aren't being challenged in the context of a collaborative environment, then make a change, whether in your work or personal life, and find someplace that will give you what you need to build your expertise.</p>
