      <p>Thank you very much.</p>
      <p>I'll be talking to you today about Home-Growing Top-Notch Developers.</p>
      <p>That sounds awesome, right?</p>
      <p>Well, it is! And not just because I'm trying to keep you awake at 5:15 on a Friday.</p>

      <p>I am Bob Holt. I work on the Open Web.</p>
      <p>I recently joined the team at Bocoup in Boston.</p>
      <p>This is the end of my second week, actually.</p>
      <p>Bocoup is an Open Web technology company by and for programmers.</p>
      <p>We create new Open Web technologies and help them become viable through consulting, training, coaching and community development.</p>
      <p>Companies to us to work the magic I'm talking to you about today for their engineering teams.</p>

      <p>I'm guessing that when I said "coaching," some of you had a knee-jerk reaction like if I said the words "social-media guru" or "I want to drill-down into leveraging your brand to deliver a greater ROI to your stakeholders."</p>
      <p>Believe me, I felt the same way until I started trying to figure out how to teach people instead of talk at them about programming.</p>
      <p>There are some solid reasons we need to look at coaching as an important part of our complete work life.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>A show of hands: how many people in here are trying to hire developers right now?</p>
      <p>And how many of you are finding it really easy to find them?</p>
      <p>Right. So the problem we're facing right now as an industry is that we all want expert developers to fill out our teams.</p>
      <p>But either there aren't enough of them to go around or we just can't find them.</p>
      <p>So we're forced to hire developers at a lower skill level than we would ideally want, and ramp them up so that we don't have to turn down paying work.</p>
      <p>This isn't necessarily a situation we want to be in, but if we can hold on to these developers, they can become valuable assets to the organization.</p>
      <p>Coaching is how we're going to make this happen.</p>

    <h2>Software Development is a Design Practice</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Secondly, let's make this clear: software development is a design practice.</p>
      <p>We as developers can probably shoulder a bit of blame for cheapening the word "design" to mean something along the lines of "making websites pretty."</p>
      <p>But design requires is really a process of thinking about the big picture and planning how everything comes together to form a complete whole.</p>
      <p>As much as we like to talk about the tech stuff in software development: libraries and algorithms and APIs, actually building applications requires a design mentality.</p>
      <p>That's why we use terms like software <em>architecture</em> and API <em>design</em>.</p>
      <p>I think that if we think about it like design, then we should teach it like design.</p>
      <p>And if we look at architecture and design, we find that they're taught in a very interesting way:</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Designers and architects have known for years that learning design requires gradually building competence alongside senior practitioners in a relatively low-risk environment.</p>
      <p>That's why design schools are set up as studios with a large practicum component and instructors coaching students to help them discover the process of design.</p>
      <p>In many studios, groups of students are as important to one another as the instructor, and sometimes even take on the coach's role.</p>
      <p>This is very different from the way we teach the rest of our professions, but as we dig into the what and how of coaching, we'll find that this type of environment is great for building expertise in any subject.</p>

      <p>Besides, why can't they do what I did and just code all night every night so that they learn everything on their own and are not at all overtired and weighing down the rest of the development team with their fatigue?"</p>

      &hellip;many experts forget what is easy and what is difficult for students <a href="#/references-1">[5]</a>.
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This idea that we are all completely self-taught, and that we got where we are by coding all night every night is largely a myth.</p>
      <p>So when a new developer asks us for help, we tend to forget every little nudge, hint, or bit of coaching we got throughout our careers.</p>
      <p>We send them off with JavaScript: The Good Parts, tell them to spend all of their free time teaching themselves, and then get frustrated when they can't recite prototypal inheritance back to us, book, chapter, and verse.</p>
      <p>For the most part, this is a waste of time for everyone involved.</p>

  <section id="outliers">
    <img src="/images/outliers.jpg" alt="Outliers: Cover Image" />

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This book. This book.</p>
      <p>Outliers popularized the idea that expertise is achieved in 10,000 hours of practice.</p>
      <p>But this is the path to madness.</p>
      <p>You can't put in 10,000 hours of doing the same thing over and over and expect to be awesome at it.</p>
      <p>The Beatles were an example of this 10,000 hour theory, and when asked about it, Paul McCartney said this: </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="mccartney">
    <blockquote>
      &hellip;I think you always will find that amount of work in the background. But I don't think it's a rule that if you do that amount of work, you're going to be as successful as the Beatles. <a href="#/references-1">[2]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>A careful reading of Outliers points out that 10,000 hours is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for expertise.</p>
      <p>We forget that because it doesn't make for good cocktail party conversation.</p>
      <p>It is only by continuing to work on harder problems - working at the edge of our competence where we actually have to try hard - that we get better.</p>

    <h2>Teach Them Noobs</h2>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>You don't have time to <em>NOT</em> coach noobs.</p>
      <p>I'll draw a comparison to unit testing.</p>
      <p>It sounds like something that adds time to your projects.</p>
      <p>And maybe it does until you get it working right.</p>
      <p>But once it's integrated into your workflow, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and you up your efficiency.</p>
      <p>In testing, this efficiency derives from automated code-checking.</p>
      <p>In coaching, it comes through a better-skilled development team.</p>

    <h2>We Want the Open Web to WIN</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>And from the perspective of growing the Open Web, we need to create a workforce that can build that out.</p>
      <p>One of reason many established companies shy away from web technologies is that they can't hire enough developers who really know how to implement them.</p>
      <p>Creating a larger, more expert workforce of JavaScript developers can only help our industry.</p>
      <p>And don't worry about your salaries: no matter what we do, there will almost certainly be a shortage of expert JS developers for a long, long time.</p>

  <section id="no-guarantee">
    <blockquote>
      The problem is not how to turn novices into experts faster&hellip; The problem is how to ensure that novices develop into experts rather than into experienced nonexperts. <a href="#/references-1">[1]</a>
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>But even if it were efficient for individuals to learn on their own, without coaching, we lose a window into what skills and habits they're actually picking up.</p>
      <p>The best case scenario is that when we leave learners to their own devices, it will take them longer to become experts.</p>
      <p>But it's more likely that they'll just work for years and get stuck at some median skill level, because nobody took the time to help them.</p>
      <p>And this is, to me, the most important reason to take an active hand in developing people.</p>
      <p>There is a distinct difference between how experts and non-experts tackle a problem, and we need to cultivate it instead of expect that it will just happen.</p>

    <blockquote>
      An expert's skill has become so much a part of him that he need be no more aware of it than he is of his own body <a href="#/references-1">[5]</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Experts have so internalized their skills that in most circumstances, they don't even have to think about the solution.</p>
      <p>That sounds really helpful, but it's more powerful than you can possibly imagine.</p>
    </aside>

  <section id="retrieval">
    <h2>Procedural Memory</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>There's this thing called "procedural memory," and it's the mechanism by which experts do this.</p>
      <p>The idea has been around since the early 1800s, but it wasn't until the last half of the 20th century that it was generally recognized as an integral part of skill acquisition and expertise.</p>
      <p>When we humans do anything, some memory of that is stored in our subconscious.</p>
      <p>When we go to repeat an action we have stored in this subconscious procedural memory, we don't have to think about it.</p>
      <p>An example of this is tying your shoes or signing your name.</p>
      <p>Over time, the abilities we can unconsciously reproduce grow in both number and complexity.</p>
      <p>Eventually, people start calling it "intuition" or "magic," and we say, "Yeah. That's right."</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So when you look at average humans, we can only keep somewhere around four things actively in mind at the same time.</p>
      <p>But anything stored in our procedural memory can be applied automatically.</p>
      <p>We don't even have to think about it.</p>
      <p>This frees up our precious brain-threads and allows us to tackle more complex problems.</p>
      <p>We're able to look at a problem and immediately pattern-match away the stuff we already know - eliminating the noise like if we put on a pair of secret decoder glasses.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>What we're left with is a reduced problem to solve.</p>
      <p>We can then leverage our book-learning against this remainder.</p>
      <p>The cool thing is that this characterizes ALL learning.</p>
      <p>The people we call "experts" just seem to have a larger repository of this kind of information.</p>
      <p>This means they are able to eliminate larger parts of the problem at a glance.</p>
      <p>This frees them up to concentrate on parts of the problem a less-expert practitioner wouldn't even be able to approach yet.</p>
      <p>This is why lesser-skilled people have work on simpler problems under a lot of direction.</p>
      <p>Their "repertoire" hasn't grown to the point where they can take on more complex problems.</p>
      <p>So let's build up this repertoire through coaching.</p>

      <p>If we think about what it means to teach, I think that the process that likely comes to mind is passing knowledge from one person to another</p>
      <p>But without reinforcing this knowledge through practical application, that knowledge is basically useless.</p>
      <p>Modern schooling since the late 19th or early 20th century is characterized by this mechanism, despite reams of research showing that it doesn't actually work that well.</p>

      <p>Who's kid is that? That's gross. (He's mine).</p>
      <p>Being an expert isn't just knowing a lot about something.</p>
      <p>When we pump someone's head full of facts and rules, we're feeding them what they call <em>declarative</em> knowledge, which - don't get me wrong - is a useful basis for expertise.</p>
      <p>This is the knowledge we turn to whenever we actually have to think about what we're doing.</p>
      <p>The problem is that this is generally theoretical knowledge.</p>
      <p>It's the what and when, but not the how or why.</p>
      <p>What we really need is the ability to apply this knowledge practically.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Lectures are notoriously awful.</p>
      <p>I think we can all agree on that.
      <p>They're so terrible largely because they're based on the same idea of pumping students full of theory until they're full, then we hand them a degree and unleash them on the real world.</p>
      <p>If anyone can walk out of a lecture retaining three major concepts, then that's a grand accomplishment.</p>
      <p>After lecturing at the university level for over twenty years, the psychologist Carl Rogers said this to a group of teachers at Harvard.</p>

      <p>In professional development circles today, we call this coaching.</p>
      <p>This is the way people can truly learn: a joint exploration of a topic between instructor and learner where both are interested in finding the answer.</p>
      <p>In software development, this can be pair programming, whiteboarding sessions, code reviews, or preferably all of that and more.</p>
      <p>Some places do these things, and that's great.</p>
      <p>But I'd say that in a majority of workplaces, they're the first things to go when deadlines come around.</p>
      <p>So, as the instructor trying to prioritize our commitments, we might lose sight of the benefits of coaching others.</p>
      <p>Benefits like a more confident, robust, and collaborative team.</p>

      <p>As I was preparing this presentation, I saw Santiago Ortiz, who was one of the speakers at the OpenVis Conf last month in Boston tweet this.</p>
      <p>When it goes well, coaching evokes this feeling of euphoric nostalgia that is really the joy of teaching.</p>
      <p>As you see someone come to grasp a particularly difficult concept, your mirror neurons - these neurons that fire both when you do an action and when you SEE someone do an action - fire, and you're transported back to when you first had your ah-ha moment.</p>
      <p>To be able to see it again through someone else's eyes is something special and magical.</p>

    <h2>Teach From Previous Experience</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>People learn in different ways and bring different ways of looking at the world into their practice.</p>
      <p>One of the best things we can do for a student is to leverage these past experiences in the new domain.</p>
      <p>What I mean is take something they understand very well that they have somehow picked up in their past, and use it as a basis for new learning.</p>
      <p>This accomplishes two things:</p>
      <p>First, when we build metaphors from experience and knowledge the student already has, it makes the new knowledge more concrete.</p>
      <p>Secondly, we're interested in ultimately transferring this knowledge into practice in order to build expertise.</p>
      <p>Knowledge transfer is a learnable skill in itself.</p>
      <p>When we create metaphors that transfer the student's existing knowledge into the new domain, we provide an implicit example of this type of knowledge transfer we want them to develop.</p>
      <p>Find an applicable metaphor from their experience to help them understand development concepts.</p>

    <h2>Make Thinking Visible</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Something else we can do for learners is to make their thinking visible.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, even when we make all of these metaphors and go the extra mile to explain something, the student still doesn't really get it.</p>
      <p>So, if we can make their thinking visible - ask them to reason our their solutions out loud, it makes any faulty conceptions or assumptions incredibly apparent.</p>
      <p>We can accomplish this through pair programming, whiteboarding, or just straight conversation.</p>
      <p>We can then use the findings from this as a new starting point for helping the student re-conceptualize the concept, possibly by adjusting or abandoning our metaphor.</p>

      <p>We need to find ways to engage the creative side of our brain in the learning process as much as the logical side.</p>
      <p>I think we're uniquely equipped in software development to do both simultaneously because of things like creative coding.</p>
      <p>When we teach programming concepts, we should be flexible enough to use something like creative coding to help our learners solidify their understanding.</p>

    <h2>Progressive Problem-Solving</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We have seen that experts are experts because they have a wealth of experience from which to draw.</p>
      <p>This experience allows them to reduce the problem they're facing to a greater degree than non-expert, which frees up more resources to attack the remainder of the problem.</p>
      <p>We need to build this repertoire through progressive problem-solving</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>To learn, we need to work at the absolute edge of our competence where we have to really figure out how to do things.</p>
      <p>When we hit the edge of our competence, we don't go in knowing the solution to our problem.</p>
      <p>In fact, this is how Bereiter and Scardamalia define problem-solving.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So, we can think about problem-solving not as supplying answers we already know, but as experimenting with different solutions in this probing, exploratory way.</p>
      <p>If we experiment with a solution, and like the result, then our experiment is affirmed.</p>
      <p>We can consider the problem solved.</p>
      <p>If we don't like the result, our experiment is negated, and we try something else.</p>

  <section id="trainings-conferences">
    <h2>Trainings and Conferences</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and conferences are great ways to introduce developers to skills you don't already have in-house.</p>
      <p>But they don't really lose their value, even after you start building an expert team.</p>
      <p>Yes, you learn new things at trainings and conferences, but I don't even think those are the most important aspects.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the two most important things you get out of trainings and conferences are inspiration and professional socialization.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="inspiration">
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and Conferences should be inspirational.</p>
      <p>There is no way someone is going to be able to retain all of the information presented in a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, a well-run training or conference should provide plenty of examples of advanced concepts.</p>
      <p>This should inspire the learner and cause them to aspire to greater expertise.</p>
      <p>In addition, great teachers and speakers can become role models of some sort for new developers.</p>
      <p>I know that speakers from the first conference I went to have been and continue to be unconscious role models for me.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Professional socialization helps to establish and reinforce appropriate social behaviors within the community.</p>
      <p>This is such an important part of being a professional that it was institutionalized hundreds of years ago in the British legal profession in what are called "Inns of Court."</p>
      <p>The Inns of Court combine the functions of a Bar Association and Social Club, and some go back to at least the 14th century.</p>
      <p>Anyone hoping to join the legal profession to this day has to go through a system of Inns of Court dinners that reinforce the social norms in the community.</p>
      <p>These Inns of Court dinners also provide opportunities for networking, benchmarking of your skills against the industry, as well as learning and even emotional support.</p>
      <p>Pretty neat.</p>

      <p>Research from the last twenty years seems to show that while competition can be helpful for some types of learners, in general a cooperative atmosphere is superior for group learning.</p>
      <p>In a cooperative atmosphere, individuals are encouraged to contribute their particular strengths to the community.</p>
      <p>This allows several people to work within on their expertise at once, constantly changing roles between learner and teacher.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>How People Learn describes bad classroom situations where this unwritten rule pervades the environment: Never get caught making a mistake or not knowing an answer.</p>
      <p>This norm can keep students from asking questions when they don't understand the material or from using experimentation to explore new questions and hypotheses.</p>
      <p>Interviews of a large number of professionals in the UK stressed the point that this is no different in a professional environment.</p>
      <p>Working in a situation where it had been easy to ask questions, without feeling embarrassed, was a considerable benefit.</p>
      <p>We WANT people to ask questions when they don't understand. We WANT people to explore groundbreaking new questions and attempt to prove new hypotheses.</p>
      <p>As we've already covered, THIS IS HOW EXPERTISE IS BUILT.</p>

  <section id="prototypal">
    <h2>Teaching Prototypal Inheritance</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>And this wasn't even my idea.</p>
      <p>Our team had a weekly-ish hour long JavaScript class intended to help what were formerly HTML and CSS-only developers come up to speed on JS.</p>
      <p>We devoted yet another session to describing and talking about prototypal inheritance.</p>
      <p>But THIS time, we had an exercise prepared for everyone: build a constructor for a pop-up modal.</p>
      <p>Then, build constructors that extend this base modal object to create a video modal, an image modal, and a form modal.</p>
      <p>It expressed the concept, but was similar to something we might use in a real project.</p>
      <p>The team could use this as a downtime project - whenever they rolled off of a project or got bored at home, they could work on it.</p>
      <p>They were free to take as long as they needed, use whatever resources they wanted, and share suggestions and discussion amongst themselves.</p>
      <p>They could also ask the other "instructor" and me for help.</p>
      <p>As each person completed the project, we would sit down as a team and code-review it.</p>

      <p>This worked like a charm.</p>
      <p>Not only was the team excited to do this, they were excited to see how everybody else approached the problem.</p>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, they seemed to complete it in order of their apparent current expertise.</p>
      <p>This was cool, because the more confident team members were code reviewed first.</p>
      <p>This eased the way for the less-confident members to see that it wasn't so bad, but to also allowed them to receive help from these more advanced developers.</p>
      <p>The five or ten minutes here or there where we would gather around a developer's desk and talk about bugs they were running into, and how the other folks' different implementations worked differently are some of the more memorable from my time there for ME.</p>
      <p>And I was the "teacher."</p>
      <p>It was awesome (and also not my idea - did I mention that?)</p>

    <h2>Don't Be A Hero</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>There are developers out there -- and perhaps there are more of them in this industry than in some others -- who are trying to do this all on their own.</p>
      <p>You have no expert community to help them grow.</p>
      <p>But, you have the discipline to sit down and force themselves to climb the ladder of expertise alone.</p>

      <p>Now I'd venture to suggest that every software developer has exhibited symptoms of this during at least <em>some</em> point in their career.</p>
      <p>Most development jobs require a minimum level of knowledge, and most JavaScript developers have to teach it to themselves.</p>

    <h2>Hire Passionate Developers and Coach Them</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This idea that motivation is a deciding factor between experts and nonexperts is why I advocate hiring for passion above almost all else.</p>
      <p>If someone is truly passionate about a subject, they will have the drive to achieve the upper limits of expertise in that subject.</p>
      <p>If not, they are likely destined to become "merely competent."</p>
      <p>Of course, there are other factors in hiring, but I have found in my experience that passion is a remarkably good predictor of success.</p>
      <p>And if we put effort into coaching them, they'll become the great developers of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>This is something we're putting into practice at Bocoup.</p>
      <p>We've opened up an "Engineering Fellow" position where we hire passionate future JavaScript developers.</p>
      <p>We'll put them through a month of training, a month of working on internal projects, and a month of shadowing "real" project work.</p>
      <p>The hope is that at the end of those three months we'll have turned them in to Bocoup-quality Open Web Engineers.</p>
      <p>So check back with me in a while to see if everything I've said here today is true.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Becoming an expert at something is a long process requiring progressive problem-solving at the edge of one's competence.</p>
      <p>We can aid this within teams by creating a cooperative atmosphere in which failure is an option and the learner is guided to discover how the practice of software design as a whole works.</p>
      <p>If we follow the model of the design studio and work as coaches alongside our learners, it will be beneficial for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>And if you're trying to improve your craft, but aren't being challenged in the context of a collaborative environment, then make a change, whether in your work or personal life, and find someplace that will give you what you need to build your expertise.</p>
