      <p>I am Bob Holt. I work on the Open Web.</p>
      <p>I recently joined the team at Bocoup in Boston.</p>
      <p>Bocoup is an Open Web technology company by and for programmers.</p>
      <p>We create new Open Web technologies and help them become viable through consulting, training, coaching and community development.</p>
      <p>Companies come to us to work the magic I'm talking to you about today for their engineering teams.</p>

      <p>I'm guessing that when I said "coaching," some of you had a knee-jerk reaction like if I said the words "social-media guru" or "I want to drill-down into leveraging your brand to deliver a greater ROI to your stakeholders."</p>
      <p>Believe me, I felt the same way until I started trying to figure out how to teach people instead of talking AT them about programming.</p>
      <p>There are some solid reasons we need to look at coaching as an important part of our complete work life.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>A show of hands: how many people in here are trying to hire developers right now?</p>
      <p>And how many of you are finding it really easy to find them?</p>
      <p>Right. So the problem we're facing right now as an industry is that we all want expert developers to fill out our teams.</p>
      <p>But either there aren't enough of them to go around or we just can't find them.</p>
      <p>So we're forced to hire developers at a lower skill level than we would ideally want, and ramp them up so that we don't have to turn down paying work.</p>
      <p>This isn't necessarily a situation we want to be in, but if we can hold on to these developers, they can become valuable assets to the organization.</p>
      <p>Coaching is how we're going to make this happen.</p>

    <h2>Software Development is a Design Practice</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Secondly, let's make this clear: software development is a design practice.</p>
      <p>We as developers can probably shoulder a bit of blame for trying to cheapen the word "design" to mean something along the lines of "making websites pretty."</p>
      <p>But design is really a process of thinking about the big picture and planning how everything comes together to form a complete whole.</p>
      <p>As much as we like to talk about the tech stuff in software development: libraries and algorithms and APIs, actually building things requires a design mentality.</p>
      <p>That's why we use terms like software <em>architecture</em> and API <em>design</em>.</p>
      <p>I think that if we think about it like design, then we should teach it like design.</p>
      <p>And if we look at architecture and design, we find that they're taught in a very interesting way:</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Designers and architects have known for years that learning design requires gradually building competence alongside senior practitioners in a relatively low-risk environment.</p>
      <p>That's why design schools are set up as studios with a large practicum component and instructors coaching students to help them discover the process of design.</p>
      <p>In many studios, groups of students are as important to one another as the instructor, and sometimes even take on the coach's role.</p>
      <p>This is very different from the way we teach the rest of our professions, but this type of environment is great for building expertise in any subject.</p>

      <p>I think this - frankly damaging - mindset has a root cause in one thing:</p>
      <p>We forget everything we went through when we learned.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This idea that we are all completely self-taught, and that we got where we are by coding all night every night is largely a myth we tell ourselves.</p>
      <p>So when a new developer asks us for help, we tend to forget every little nudge, hint, or bit of coaching we got throughout our careers, whether in person or on StackOverflow or whatever.</p>
      <p>We send them off with JavaScript: The Good Parts, tell them to spend all of their free time teaching themselves, and then we get frustrated when they can't implement prototypal inheritance.</p>
      <p>For the most part, this is a waste of time for everyone involved.</p>

  <section id="outliers">
    <img src="/images/outliers.jpg" alt="Outliers: Cover Image" />

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>This book. This book.</p>
      <p>Outliers popularized the idea that expertise is achieved in 10,000 hours of practice the same thing over and over.</p>
      <p>But this is the path to madness.</p>
      <p>You can't just put in 10,000 hours of mindless practice into something and expect to be awesome at it.</p>
      <p>The Beatles were an example of this 10,000 hour theory, and when asked about it, Paul McCartney said this: </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="mccartney">
    <blockquote>
      <p>&hellip;I think you always will find that amount of work in the background. But I don't think it's a rule that if you do that amount of work, you're going to be as successful as the Beatles.</p>
      <p class="cite">Paul McCartney <a href="#/references-1">[2]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>A careful reading of Outliers points out that 10,000 hours is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for expertise.</p>
      <p>We forget that because it doesn't make for good cocktail party conversation.</p>
      <p>It is only by continuing to work on harder problems - working right at the edge of our competence where we actually have to try hard, and have the risk of failure - that we get better.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="no-guarantee">
    <blockquote>
      <p>The problem is not how to turn novices into experts faster&hellip; The problem is how to ensure that novices develop into experts rather than into experienced nonexperts.</p>
      <p class="cite"><em>Surpassing Ourselves</em> <a href="#/references-1">[1]</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>But even if it were efficient for individuals to learn on their own, without coaching, we lose a window into what skills and habits they're actually picking up.</p>
      <p>The best case scenario is that when we leave learners to their own devices, it will take them longer to become experts.</p>
      <p>But it's more likely that they'll just work for years and get stuck at some median skill level, because nobody took the time to help them.</p>
      <p>And this is, to me, the most important reason to take an active hand in developing people.</p>
      <p>There is a distinct difference between how experts and non-experts tackle a problem, and we need to cultivate expertise instead of expect that it will just happen.</p>
      <p>So you don't have time to <em>NOT</em> coach noobs.</p>

      <p>From a community perspective, there's another reason for all of us to train developers.</p>
      <p>We want the Open Web to win.</p>
      <p>And from the perspective of growing the Open Web, we need to create a workforce that can build that out.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons many established companies shy away from web technologies is that they can't hire enough developers who really know how to implement them.</p>
      <p>Creating a larger, more expert workforce of JavaScript developers keeps what we do viable as a development technology.</p>
      <p>And don't worry about your salaries: no matter what we do, there will almost certainly be a shortage of expert JS developers for a long, long time.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>An expert's skill has become so much a part of him that he need be no more aware of it than he is of his own body.</p>
      <p class="cite"><em>Mind Over Machine</em> <a href="#/references-1">[4]</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Experts have so internalized their skills that in most circumstances, they don't even have to think about the solution.</p>
      <p>That sounds really helpful, but it's more powerful than you can possibly imagine.</p>

  <section id="retrieval">
    <h2>Procedural Memory</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>There's this thing called "procedural memory," and it's the mechanism by which experts do this.</p>
      <p>The idea has been around since the early 1800s, but it wasn't until the last half of the 20th century that it was generally recognized as an integral part of skill acquisition and expertise.</p>
      <p>When we humans do anything, some memory of that is stored in our subconscious.</p>
      <p>When we go to repeat an action we have stored in this subconscious procedural memory, we don't have to think about it.</p>
      <p>An example of this is tying your shoes or signing your name.</p>
      <p>Over time, the abilities we can unconsciously reproduce grow in both number and complexity.</p>
      <p>Eventually, people start calling it "intuition" or "magic," and we say, "Yeah. That's right."</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>So when you look at average humans, we can only keep somewhere around four things actively in mind at the same time.</p>
      <p>But anything stored in our procedural memory can be applied automatically.</p>
      <p>We don't even have to think about it.</p>
      <p>This frees up our precious brain-threads and allows us to tackle more complex problems.</p>
      <p>We're able to look at a problem and immediately pattern-match away the stuff we already know - eliminating the noise like if we put on a pair of secret decoder glasses.</p>

    <img src="images/decoder.jpg" alt="Decoder Glasses"/>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>What we're left with is a reduced problem to solve.</p>
      <p>We can then leverage our book-learning against this remainder.</p>
      <p>The cool thing is that this characterizes ALL learning.</p>
      <p>The people we call "experts" just seem to have a larger repository of this kind of information.</p>
      <p>This means they are able to eliminate larger parts of the problem at a glance.</p>
      <p>This frees them up to concentrate on parts of the problem a less-expert practitioner wouldn't even be able to approach yet.</p>
      <p>This is why lesser-skilled people have to work on simpler problems under a lot of direction.</p>
      <p>Their "repertoire" hasn't grown to the point where they can take on more complex problems.</p>

      <p>If we think about what it means to teach, I think that the process that likely comes to mind is passing knowledge from one person to another</p>
      <p>But without reinforcing this knowledge through practical application, that knowledge is basically useless.</p>
      <p>Modern schooling since the late 19th or early 20th century is characterized by this mechanism, despite reams of research showing that it doesn't actually work that well.</p>

      <p>Who's kid is that? That's gross. (He's mine).</p>
      <p>Being an expert isn't just knowing a lot about something.</p>
      <p>When we pump someone's head full of facts and rules, we're feeding them what they call <em>declarative</em> knowledge, which - don't get me wrong - is a useful basis for expertise.</p>
      <p>This is the knowledge we turn to after we've reduced our problem through pattern-matching and we actually have to think about what we're doing.</p>
      <p>The problem is that this is generally theoretical knowledge.</p>
      <p>It's the what and when, but not the how or why.</p>
      <p>What we really need is the ability to apply this knowledge practically.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Lectures are notoriously awful.</p>
      <p>I think we can all agree on that.
      <p>They're so terrible largely because they're based on the same idea of pumping students full of theory until they're full, then we hand them a degree and unleash them on the real world.</p>
      <p>If anyone can walk out of a lecture retaining three major concepts, then that's a grand accomplishment.</p>

      <p>In professional development circles today, we call this coaching.</p>
      <p>This is the way people can truly learn: a joint exploration of a topic between instructor and learner where both are interested in finding the answer.</p>
      <p>In software development, this can be pair programming, whiteboarding sessions, code reviews, or preferably all of that and more.</p>
      <p>Some places do these things, and that's great.</p>
      <p>But I'd say that in a majority of workplaces, they're the first things to go when deadlines come around.</p>
      <p>So, as the instructor trying to prioritize our commitments, we might lose sight of the benefits of coaching others.</p>
      <p>Benefits like a more confident, robust, and collaborative team.</p>

      <p>As I was preparing this presentation, I saw Santiago Ortiz, who was one of the speakers at the OpenVis Conf last month in Boston tweet this.</p>
      <p>When it goes well, coaching evokes this feeling of euphoric nostalgia that is really the joy of teaching.</p>
      <p>As you see someone come to grasp a particularly difficult concept, your mirror neurons - these neurons that fire both when you do an action and when you SEE someone do an action - fire, and you're transported back to when you first had your ah-ha moment.</p>
      <p>To be able to see it again through someone else's eyes is something special and magical.</p>
      <p>So be selfish. Don't do it because it helps your team. Do it because it feels good.</p>

    <h2>Teach From Previous Experience</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>People learn in different ways and bring different ways of looking at the world into their practice.</p>
      <p>One of the best things we can do for a student is to leverage these past experiences in the new domain.</p>
      <p>What I mean is take something they understand very well that they have somehow picked up in their past, and use it as a basis for new learning.</p>
      <p>When we build metaphors from experience and knowledge the student already has, it makes the new knowledge more concrete.</p>
      <p>Rachel Nabors had some great examples of this in her "JavaScript for Designers" talk yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>So many introduction to JavaScript books assume that the reader is coming from a programming background.</p>
      <p>The metaphors are based on programming concepts.</p>

      <p>So I may have said this in a less-than charitable moment, and I don't REALLY think that.</p>

      <p>I don't think that it's actually any harder to teach anyone coming from any other subject if we do it right.</p>
      <p>Especially if we can use metaphors like Rachel's, which were beautiful.</p>
      <p>She compared Object prototype to a genetic blueprint that can is transferred, but slightly modified by succeeding generations of children.</p>
      <p>And she compared APIs to airlocks in a biodome.</p>

    <h2>Make Thinking Visible</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Something else we can do for learners is to make their thinking visible.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, even when we make all of these metaphors and go the extra mile to explain something, the student still doesn't really get it.</p>
      <p>So, if we can make their thinking visible - ask them to reason our their solutions out loud, it makes any faulty conceptions or assumptions incredibly apparent.</p>
      <p>We can accomplish this through pair programming, whiteboarding, or just straight conversation.</p>
      <p>We can then use the findings from this as a new starting point for helping the student re-conceptualize the concept, possibly by adjusting or abandoning our metaphor.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>We typically focus on learning as a process that targets the logical portion of our brain.</p>
      <p>But there's this whole creative side to our brain.</p>
      <p>Now hopefully you were all in Jenn Schiffer's talk on creative coding earlier today.</p>
      <p>If you weren't, I suggest watching the video as soon as you can, because it was awesome.</p>
      <p>We need to find ways to engage the creative side of our brain in the learning process as much as the logical side, and she showed us some great ways to do it.</p>
      <p>I think we're uniquely equipped in software development to do learn with both the creative and logical side simultaneously BECAUSE of things like creative coding.</p>
      <p>When we teach programming concepts, we should be embrace anything like creative coding to help our learners solidify their understanding.</p>

      <p>This experience allows them to reduce the problem they're facing to a greater degree than non-expert, which frees up more resources to attack the remainder of the problem.</p>
      <p>We need to build this repertoire through progressive problem-solving</p>
      <p>To learn, we need to work at the absolute edge of our competence where we have to really figure out how to do things.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and conferences are great ways to introduce developers to skills you don't already have in-house.</p>
      <p>And they maintain their value, even after you start building an expert team.</p>
      <p>Yes, you learn new things at trainings and conferences, but I don't think that's the most important aspect.</p>
      <p>I think that the two most important things you get out of trainings and conferences are inspiration and professional socialization.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Trainings and Conferences should be inspirational.</p>
      <p>There is no way someone is going to be able to retain all of the information that was presented in such a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, a well-run training or conference should provide plenty of examples of advanced concepts that tease people into exploring on their own.</p>
      <p>This should inspire us and make us want to immediately start putting some of the stuff into practice.</p>
      <p>I saw so many tweets after Jenn's talk about wanting to go do some creative coding.</p>
      <p>That's what it's all about!</p>
      <p>But not only that, but great teachers and speakers can become role models of some sort for new developers.</p>
      <p>I know that speakers from the first conference I went to have been and continue to be unconscious role models for me.</p>
      <p>Some of them are in this room, or maybe even watching online.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The other benefit of conferences is the professional socialization we have.</p>
      <p>Professional socialization helps to establish and reinforce appropriate behaviors within the community.</p>
      <p>This is something we seem to constantly need to be reminded of.</p>
      <p>This is such an important part of being a professional that it was institutionalized hundreds of years ago in the British legal profession in what are called "Inns of Court."</p>
      <p>The Inns of Court combine the functions of a Bar Association and Social Club, and some go back to at least the 14th century.</p>
      <p>Anyone hoping to join the legal profession to this day has to go through a system of Inns of Court dinners that reinforce the social norms in the community.</p>
      <p>These Inns of Court dinners also provide opportunities for networking, benchmarking of your skills against the industry, as well as learning and even emotional support.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>How People Learn describes bad classroom situations where this unwritten rule pervades the environment: Never get caught making a mistake or not knowing an answer.</p>
      <p>This norm can keep students from asking questions when they don't understand the material or from using experimentation to explore new questions and hypotheses.</p>
      <p>Interviews of a large number of professionals in the UK stressed the point that this is no different in a professional environment.</p>
      <p>Working in a situation where it had been easy to ask questions without feeling embarrassed, was a considerable benefit.</p>
      <p>We WANT people to ask questions when they don't understand. We WANT people to explore groundbreaking new questions and attempt to prove new hypotheses.</p>

      <p>These places should be our Inns of Court, reinforcing what should be industry norms like "diversity," "acceptance," and "a welcoming, cooperative environment."</p>

      <p>Or perhaps worse than that, we look at someone and immediately decide whether they're "one of us" or a "non-developer" or a "bad developer."</p>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>And this wasn't even my idea.</p>
      <p>Our team had a weekly-ish hour long JavaScript class intended to help what were formerly HTML and CSS-only developers come up to speed on JS.</p>
      <p>We devoted yet another session to describing and talking about prototypal inheritance.</p>
      <p>But THIS time, we had an exercise prepared for everyone: build a constructor for a pop-up modal.</p>
      <p>Then, build constructors that extend this base modal object to create a video modal, an image modal, and a form modal.</p>
      <p>It expressed the concept of prototypal, but was also similar to something we might use in a real project.</p>
      <p>The team could use this as a downtime project - whenever they rolled off of client work or got bored at home, they could work on it.</p>
      <p>They were free to take as long as they needed, use whatever resources they wanted, and share suggestions and discussion amongst themselves.</p>
      <p>They could also ask the other "instructor" and me for help.</p>
      <p>As each person completed the project, we would sit down as a team and code-review it.</p>

      <p>Not only was the team excited to do this, they were excited to see how everybody else approached the problem.</p>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, they seemed to complete it in order of their apparent current level of expertise.</p>
      <p>This was cool, because the more confident team members were code reviewed first.</p>
      <p>This eased the way for the less-confident members to see that code reviews weren't so bad, but it also allowed them to receive more help from these more advanced developers.</p>
      <p>The five or ten minutes here or there where we would gather around a developer's desk and talk about bugs they were running into, and how the other folks' different implementations worked differently are some of the more memorable experiences from my time there for ME.</p>
      <p>And I was the "teacher."</p>

    <h2>Hire Passionate Developers and Coach Them</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>And now for team leads or hiring managers:</p>
      <p>The difference between experts and non-experts is this practical repository of knowledge we talked about.</p>
      <p>But the reason they develop this repertoire comes down to opportunity and motivation.</p>
      <p>We can do something about opportunity if we focus on coaching, but we can't do much about motivation to excel.</p>
      <p>This is why I advocate hiring for passion above almost all else.</p>
      <p>If someone is truly passionate about a subject, they will have the drive to achieve the upper limits of expertise in that subject.</p>
      <p>If not, they are likely destined to become "merely competent" in that subject and focus on something else where they are motivated to excel.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are other factors in hiring, but I have found in my experience that passion is a remarkably good predictor of success.</p>
      <p>And if we put effort into coaching them, they'll become the great developers of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>This is something we're putting into practice at Bocoup.</p>
      <p>We've opened up an "Engineering Fellow" position where we're looking to hire passionate developers or prospective developers who maybe haven't had the opportunity to build their JavaScript skills so far in their careers.</p>
      <p>We'll put them through a month of training, a month of working on internal projects with coaching, and a month of shadowing a full-time employee on "real" project work.</p>
      <p>The hope is that at the end of those three months we'll have turned them in to Bocoup-quality Open Web Engineers.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Becoming an expert at something is a long process requiring progressive problem-solving at the edge of one's competence.</p>
      <p>We can aid this within teams by creating a cooperative atmosphere in which failure is an option and the learner is guided to discover how the practice of software design as a whole works.</p>
      <p>If we follow the model of the design studio and work as coaches alongside our learners, it will be beneficial for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>And if you're trying to improve your craft, but aren't being challenged in the context of a collaborative environment, then make a change, whether in your work or personal life, and find someplace that will give you what you need to build your expertise.</p>
